                <h2>Here is a time line of Joseph Fraunhofer's life</h2>

                    <li><strong>1799-1804</strong> - The young Fraunhofer completes an apprenticeship with the mirror maker and decorative glass cutter Philipp Anton Weichselberger in Munich.</li>
                    <li><strong>1801</strong> - Weichselberger`s house collapses; Fraunhofer is buried among the ruins. During the rescue work he comes into contact with the privy councilor Joseph von Utzschneider and prince-elector Maximilian IV Joseph.</li>
                    <li><strong>1804-1806</strong> - Fraunhoferworks as an assistant to Weichselberger.</li>
                    <li><strong>1806</strong> - Fraunhofer becomes an optician at the Mathematical-Mechanical Institute run by Reichenbach, Utzschneider and Liebherr in Munich.</li>
                    <li><strong>1808</strong> - Fraunhofer works as a glass grinder in the Benediktbeuern glassworks, part of the Mathematical-Mechanical Institute; he publishes his first scholarly essay.</li>
                    <li><strong>1809</strong> - Apart from melting the glass, Fraunhofer is responsible for the entire glass production process in Benediktbeuern.</li>
                    <li><strong>1811</strong> - Fraunhofer takes over as overall head of the glassworks of the Mathematical-Mechanical Institute in Benediktbeuern.</li>
                    <li><strong>1814</strong> - Fraunhofer takes over as overall head of the glassworks of the Mathematical-Mechanical Institute in Benediktbeuern.</li>
                    <li><strong>1817</strong> - The Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences names Fraunhofer a corresponding member.</li>
                    <li><strong>1819</strong> - Mathematical-Mechanical Institute moves to Munich.</li>
                    <li><strong>1821</strong> - After some heated debate surrounding his lack of academic training, Fraunhofer is appointed extraordinary visiting member of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences.</li>
