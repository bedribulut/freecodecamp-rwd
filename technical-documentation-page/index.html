                            <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The <strong>.css</strong> extension shows that this is a <strong>CSS</strong> file.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the HTML document:</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                        <div class="bgc">
                            <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&quot;&gt;</code>
                        </div>

                <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>By making our heading red, we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document, you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green, you would use:</p>
                    <div class="bgc">
                        <code>
                            p {<br>
                                color: green;<br>
                              }                          
                        </code>
                        <p>You can target multiple selectors at the same time by separating the selectors with a comma. If you want all paragraphs and all list items to be green, your rule would look like this:</p>
                        <code>
                            p, li {<br>
                                color: green;<br>
                            }                        
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </article>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Changing_the_default_behavior_of_elements">
                <header>Changing the default behavior of elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style everything from scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.</p>
                    <p>However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done by choosing the HTML element that you want to change and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks. A good example is <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, an unordered list. It has list bullets. If you don't want those bullets, you can remove them like so:</p>
                    <div class="bgc">
                        <code>
                            li {<br>
                                list-style-type: none;<br>
                              }                          
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </article>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_class">
                <header>Adding a class</header>
                <article>
                    <p>So far, we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>
                    <p>In your HTML document, add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class">class attribute</a> to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:</p>
                    <div class="bgc">
                        <code>
                            &lt;ul&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li class=&quot;special&quot;&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                            &lt;/ul&gt;
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>In your CSS, you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>
                    <code>
                        .special {<br>
                            color: orange;<br>
                            font-weight: bold;<br>
                          }                          
                    </code>
                    <p>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</p>

                <header>Styling things based on their location in a document</header>
                <article>
                    <p>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document. There are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple. In our document, there are two <strong>em</strong> elements — one inside a paragraph and the other inside a list item. To select only an <strong>em</strong> that is nested inside an <strong>li</strong> element, you can use a selector called the descendant combinator, which takes the form of a space between two other selectors.</p>
                    <p>Add the following rule to your stylesheet:</p>
                    <div class="bgc">
                        <code>
                            li em {<br>
                                color: rebeccapurple;<br>
                              }                          
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>This selector will select any <strong>em</strong> element that is inside (a descendant of) an <strong>li</strong>. So in your example document, you should find that the <strong>em</strong> in the third list item is now purple, but the one inside the paragraph is unchanged.</p>
